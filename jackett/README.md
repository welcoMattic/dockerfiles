## Description
What is [jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) ?

This project is a new fork and is recruiting development help. If you are able to help out please contact us.

Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.

Developer note: The software implements the Torznab (with nZEDb category numbering) and TorrentPotato APIs.
